### DATA ANALYSIS

Using Tableau, two groups were created. The first was used on the ‘Cancelled (0/1)’ column. It shows ‘1’ if the booking was cancelled and, ‘0’ if it was the opposite. This column had to be grouped so as to filter and count the cancelled and not cancelled bookings.
Lead time range was needed for the analysis. The column for lead time had values running from 0 – 790. For effective analysis, the values were grouped in the range of:  0 – 99, 100 – 199, 200 – 299, 300 – 399, 400 – 499, 500 – 599, 600 – 699, 700 – 799. 

### RESULTS

It was observed that:
-	Based on the type of customer, transient customer made the organization the most revenue (22,696,814) and also made the most loss (11,502,290).
-	From the bookings that were not cancelled, the organization made 25,966,324. From the cancelled bookings, the organization lost 13,122,900 and gained 3,604,337 from non-refundable deposits.
-	Online travel agent brought about the most loss for the organization (10,782,871) and also the most profit (17,255,124).
